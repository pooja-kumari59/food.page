            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.8MJgw49NgTeBLs1BFzqS0gHaHa?w=187&h=188&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" alt="burger">
            <p>
                A delicious burger is a perfect blend of juicy flavors and textures. It starts with a soft, lightly toasted bun, warm and slightly crisp on the outside. Inside, a perfectly seasoned beef patty, cooked to juicy perfection, provides the hearty base. Melty cheese drapes over the patty, while fresh lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and crunchy pickles add a refreshing crunch. A tangy, creamy sauce ties all the elements together, giving every bite a burst of savory goodness. Whether topped with onions, bacon, or avocado, each bite is a mouthwatering combination of textures and flavors.

            <h2>Momos</h2>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ3BT8ai9V68p50ltRUbDm4sIc9xBu2eGfRaw&s" alt="Momos">
            <p>
                Momos are a popular delicacy, especially in Himalayan regions, known for their soft, doughy exterior and flavorful fillings. These bite-sized dumplings are usually steamed or fried to perfection. The filling can vary from minced meat (chicken, pork, or lamb) to a vegetarian mix of finely chopped vegetables like cabbage, carrots, and onions, often spiced with garlic, ginger, and chilies. Served hot, momos are paired with a spicy, tangy dipping sauce (chutney) made from tomatoes, garlic, and red chili. The result is a deliciously comforting snack with a satisfying combination of soft, juicy, and spicy flavors.
